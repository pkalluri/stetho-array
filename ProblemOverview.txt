Ascultation relies on external measurement of signals within the body to detect
and understand internal anomalies, and diagnose and treat patients.
The stethoscope is the primary tool for ascultation, but many doctors,
including the clinician mentor I worked with, state the process of ascultation via
traditional stethoscope has not seen significant innovation in many years.

I propose that multi-stethoscope arrays are a potential avenue to innovation
in ascultation. Smart signal processing comparing signal information
across an array could allow faster, higher precision, or more successful
triangulation and tracking of the location and paths of sounds/signals in
the body. Multi-stethoscope arrays will require thoughtfully-designed,
efficient signal processing algorithms to (1) Provide proof of concept,
(2) Understand constraints/scope of such a device, (3) Understand important
optimizations, and (4) Implement the final device. 

The program included here emphasizes (1), and sets up a foundation for (2) & (3).
In particular, it provides computational evidence that 
self-positioned arrays of listeners can facilitate successful, precise
reconstruction, localization, and visualization of paths of otherwise unknown
signals -- and does so through parametrizable code that allows exploration of
device constraints/optimizations.
