CODE OVERVIEW

The SoundReconstruction directory contains all code necessary to run the 
main program. The user shoud
    - Update the PARAMETERS file
        to reflect a physical system including signal emitters and listeners
    - Run the RUNNER file
        This will load the user-given parameters and model the implied physical
        system including signal emitters and listeners.
        Then, forgetting all known emitter information, it will attempt to
        reconstruct the emitter information from only listeners' information.
All matrix data representations are documented in the code.
        
The _Miscelaneous_ directory is currently a smorgasborg of code that is 
potentially useful in next steps, but is not incorporated into the
current program. It should be cleaned up shortly.
